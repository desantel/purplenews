## Motivation
There are many sides to a story including the news. There are so many sites that present on the same topic but will present it from a specific point of view. If the reader wants a different side to the story, they will have to search a different website. Let's be honest, how many people search liberal, conservative, and neutral sites to get the full picture of a story? Purple News was created as a one stop shop so someone can research a topic and find different perspectives. The goal is to reduce cognitive bias.

## Screenshots and Demos

## Features
This application features _____.

## Unique elements

## CSS Elements
The first CSS framework considered was SimpleCSS but it was extremely basic which would probably not offer a great deal of customization. It was recommended that the Foundation CSS framework be used. 

## Problems faced
One problem we faced included finding free news APIs that included articles. 

## API Reference
The initial APIs that were going to be used were NewsAPI and Currents API. However, the free version for NewsAPI required CORS. The free version of Currents API did not provide access to articles. Therefore, we had to locate a different API. We chose Mediastack API which provided a variety of news sources. For our second API, we used GIPHY API to add political gifs to our site.
